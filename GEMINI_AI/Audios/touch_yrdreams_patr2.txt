Don't let them tell you it is impossible.
That is what they told all heroes before.
In a hero's mind, the word "does not" exist.
When you're eighty years old,
thinking about your past, 
regretting every minute of your life that you've lost,
you will wonder where the time went.
If you do the right thing, 
it could be talking to you.
Don't hesitate, grab the chance before it's too late.
Reach out and touch your dream.
Reach out and touch your dream.
Reach out and touch your dream.
Reach out and touch your dream.
Reach out and touch your dream.
Reach out and touch your dream.
Reach out and touch your dream.
Reach out and touch your dream.
The end (with love❤💛💚)
